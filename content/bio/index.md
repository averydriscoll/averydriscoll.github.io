# About Me

I recently completed my PhD in Soil and Crop Science with the [Agricultural Sustainability and Climate Impacts lab](https://ascilab.colostate.edu/) at Colorado State University, where my work focused on irrigation-related greenhouse gas emssions. I am very excited to be joining the [Purdue Agroecology Laboratory](https://ag.purdue.edu/department/agry/lab-sites/pal/index.html) as a postdoc at the start of 2026. 

Prior to grad school, I worked for several years with the [Ehleringer lab](https://www.ehleringer.net/) after receiving my BS in Environmental Studies from Westminster College in Salt Lake City. In a previous career, I was an aerialist on the US Ski Team. Outside of science, I spend my time cooking, gardening, traveling, and playing outside.
