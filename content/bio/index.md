I recently completed my PhD in Soil and Crop Science with the [Agricultural Sustainability and Climate Impacts lab](https://ascilab.colostate.edu/) at Colorado State University, where my work focused on irrigation-related greenhouse gas emissions. I am very excited to be joining the [Purdue Agroecology Laboratory](https://ag.purdue.edu/department/agry/lab-sites/pal/index.html) as a postdoc at the start of 2026. For the last year, I have also worked as part of an interdisciplinary team at Project Drawdown to develop the [Drawdown Explorer](https://drawdown.org/explorer), a public-facing library of climate solutions, focusing on nutrient management and ecosystem protection. I am available for consulting related to greenhouse gas emissions accounting and mitigation, particularly in the context of agriculture and land use change.

Prior to grad school, I received my BS in Environmental Studies from Westminster College in Salt Lake City and then worked for several years with the [Ehleringer lab](https://www.ehleringer.net/). In a previous career, I was an aerialist on the US Ski Team. Outside of science, I spend my time cooking, gardening, traveling, and playing outside.
