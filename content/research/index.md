## Desert Plant Ecophysiology

My [partner](https://www.stevekannenberg.com/) and I have taken over the project as Jim enters retirement, and we still lead a team to the field each year for surveys and sampling. 

## Coffee Provenancing with Stable Isotopes

In this project, we used [oxygen stable isotope ratios](https://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.8626) and [trace element ratios](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.126602) to map the origin of coffee beans. Oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios in water vary spatially, and that signal is reflected in plant tissues. Similarly, trace element ratios can reflect local soil chemistry. This project was part of a successful lawsuit brought by Kona coffee farmers against retailers alleged to be making false marketing claims related to the coffee origin. This lawsuit, including the contributions of our analysis, was later covered by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/18/science/kona-coffee-hawaii-authenticity.html),
