This long-term monitoring project was started by [Dr. Jim Ehleringer](https://www.ehleringer.net/) in the early 1980s. Over the past 45 years, four populations of desert shrubs have been revisited annually to survey growth, death, and establishment of individuals, and to collect leaf samples for analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes. This extensive record of plant carbon, water, and nitrogen relations has established [large increases in plant water use efficiency driven by climate change](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2008345117), revealed [strong effects of plant age on leaf nitrogen isotope ratios](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17668), and demonstrated [plant-level relationships between water use efficiency and growth and reproduction](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04825-3). My [partner](https://www.stevekannenberg.com/) and I have taken over leading annual surveys as Jim enters retirement, and we host a [web app](https://www.stevekannenberg.com/about-1) that enables student interaction with the database.

## Coffee Provenancing with Stable Isotopes

In this project, we used [oxygen stable isotope ratios](https://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.8626) and [trace element ratios](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.126602) to map the origin of coffee beans. Oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios in water vary spatially, and that signal is reflected in plant tissues. Similarly, trace element ratios can reflect local soil chemistry. This project was part of a successful lawsuit brought by Kona coffee farmers against retailers alleged to be making false marketing claims related to the coffee origin. This lawsuit, including the contributions of our analysis, was later covered by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/18/science/kona-coffee-hawaii-authenticity.html),
