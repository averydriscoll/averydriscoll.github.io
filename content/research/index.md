The core goal of my research program is to identify effective and scalable ways for our food systems to respond to climate change. I work on quantifying the effects of agricultural management and policy on both crop production and environmental impacts, especially greenhouse gas emissions. Current projects of interest involve 1) improving estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from land use change, 2) improving representation of agricultural water management in process-based crop models, and 3) improving understanding of how changes to crop productivity propagate through the global economy to influence agricultural land use. Below you will find some examples of published projects that I have led.

## Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Irrigation

We mapped the greenhouse gas emissions from irrigation across the United States at the county scale in order to better understand the impacts and mitigation opportunities associated with irrigation. Irrigation drives direct, on-farm greenhouse gas emissions through energy use, increases in denitrification due to elevated soil moisture, and degassing of carbon dioxide from supersaturated groundwater. Together, these pathways produce approximately 18.9 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> annually, heavily driven by energy use (72% of emissions) and groundwater irrigation (79% of emissions). We also assessed mitigation potential of irrigation energy use emissions, finding that current grid decarbonization trends coupled with modest additional adoption of electrical pumps could dramatically reduce energy-use emissions. This work was covered by [The Colorado Sun](https://coloradosun.com/2024/08/05/colorado-researchers-new-data-greenhouse-gases-irrigation/).

Read more about total direct GHG emissions from US irrigation [here](https://rdcu.be/dPEX6), or dive into the details of energy use for irrigation pumping [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-44920-0). The data for both papers are freely available on Zenodo ([data for N. Comms 2024](https://zenodo.org/records/10416689); [data for N. Water 2024](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12552398)), and I welcome inquiries from those interested in using the data!


## Crop Diversity and Yield Stability

The link between plant diversity and the stability of ecosystem function is an age-old ecological question. We [evaluated this relationship](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aca2be/meta#erlaca2bes2) in the context of the caloric and economic production of US crop using state-level data from the US Department of Agriculture. We found that crop diversity improved the stability of economic, but not caloric yields, suggesting that price responses can buffer against interannual yield variability and help to stabilize revenues. This project began as part of a Colorado State University course on environmental data science, and was ultimately co-authored by all of the students in the class.

The data and code for this project are freely available [here](https://zenodo.org/records/7332106), and include harmonized and gap-filled USDA Census data on the area and production of 90 crops from 1981-2020.

## Desert Plant Ecophysiology

This long-term monitoring project was started by [Dr. Jim Ehleringer](https://www.ehleringer.net/) in the early 1980s. Over the past 45 years, four populations of desert shrubs have been revisited annually to survey growth, death, and establishment of individuals, and to collect leaf samples for analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes. This effort has produced an extensive record of plant carbon, water, and nitrogen relations. Among many, many other papers that preceed my time, this dataset has established large increases in plant water use efficiency driven by [climate change](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2008345117) and [the megadrought](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2118052118), revealed [strong effects of plant age on leaf nitrogen isotope ratios](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17668), and demonstrated [plant-level relationships between water use efficiency and growth and reproduction](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04825-3). My [partner](https://www.stevekannenberg.com/) and I have taken over leading annual surveys as Jim enters retirement, and we host a [web app](https://www.stevekannenberg.com/about-1) that enables student interaction with the database. Please get in touch if you are interested in using the data.


## Coffee Provenancing with Stable Isotopes

<img align="center"

In this project, we used [oxygen stable isotope ratios](https://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.8626) and [trace element ratios](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.126602) to map the origin of coffee beans. Oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios in water vary spatially, and that signal is reflected in plant tissues. Similarly, trace element ratios can reflect local soil chemistry. This project was part of a successful lawsuit brought by Kona coffee farmers against retailers alleged to be making false marketing claims related to the coffee origin. This lawsuit, including the contributions of our analysis, was later covered by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/18/science/kona-coffee-hawaii-authenticity.html).
