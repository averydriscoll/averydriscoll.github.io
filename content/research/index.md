## Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Irrigation

In this project, we sought to quantify the net greenhouse gas impacts of irrigation across the United States at the county scale. Irrigation drives direct, on-farm greenhouse gas emissions through energy use, increases in denitrification due to elevated soil moisture, and degassing of carbon dioxide from supersaturated groundwater. Together, these pathways produce approximately 18.9 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> annually, heavily driven by energy use (72% of emissions) and groundwater irrigation (79% of emissions). We also assessed mitigation potential of irrigation energy use emissions, finding that current grid decarbonization trends coupled with modest additional adoption of electrical pumps could dramatically reduce energy-use emissions. Read more about total direct GHG emissions from US irrigation [here](https://rdcu.be/dPEX6), or dive into the details of energy use for irrigation pumping [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-44920-0). The data for both papers are freely available on Zenodo ([data for N. Comms 2024](https://zenodo.org/records/10416689); [data for N. Water 2024](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12552398)), and I welcome inquiries from researchers interested in using the data.

This long-term monitoring project was started by [Dr. Jim Ehleringer](https://www.ehleringer.net/) in the early 1980s. Over the past 45 years, four populations of desert shrubs have been revisited annually to survey growth, death, and establishment of individuals, and to collect leaf samples for analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes. This effort has produced an extensive record of plant carbon, water, and nitrogen relations. Among many, many other papers, this dataset has established [large increases in plant water use efficiency driven by climate change](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2008345117) and [the megadrought](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2118052118), revealed [strong effects of plant age on leaf nitrogen isotope ratios](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17668), and demonstrated [plant-level relationships between water use efficiency and growth and reproduction](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04825-3). My [partner](https://www.stevekannenberg.com/) and I have taken over leading annual surveys as Jim enters retirement, and we host a [web app](https://www.stevekannenberg.com/about-1) that enables student interaction with the database. Please get in touch if you are interested in using the data.

## Coffee Provenancing with Stable Isotopes

In this project, we used [oxygen stable isotope ratios](https://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.8626) and [trace element ratios](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.126602) to map the origin of coffee beans. Oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios in water vary spatially, and that signal is reflected in plant tissues. Similarly, trace element ratios can reflect local soil chemistry. This project was part of a successful lawsuit brought by Kona coffee farmers against retailers alleged to be making false marketing claims related to the coffee origin. This lawsuit, including the contributions of our analysis, was later covered by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/18/science/kona-coffee-hawaii-authenticity.html),
